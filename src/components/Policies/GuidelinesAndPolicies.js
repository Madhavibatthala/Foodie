          <p>
            If there's one thing we truly love, it's sharing in all the great
            foodie moments you have. Bouquets when the food exceeds your
            expectations, brickbats when the service is shocking, chronicles of
            your food excursions - they all count.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we welcome your opinions and descriptions of your dining
            experiences, there are a few things we expect from every user on
            Zomato. Your reviews and photos, as well as your profile and the
            comments you share, are all subject to Content Guidelines, our
            Foodie Code of Conduct.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your activity on Zomato doesn't match up to these content
            guidelines, we reserve the right to take action as we deem
            necessary. This could include altering or deleting your reviews or
            comments, restricting your review activity or deleting your Zomato
            account altogether, with or without notice. Zomato also utilizes an
            algorithm to aid in removing suspicious reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you see content that does not align with these guidelines or our
            Terms of Service, please let us know. We will consider all reports.
            However, due to the diversity of our community, it is possible that
            content disagreeable to you might not meet the criteria to be
            removed.

                To make sure we collectively work towards building the
                highest-quality content that's useful to everyone, reviews need
                to be a minimum of 140 characters long for dine-in reviews.
                That's just about the length of a tweet, so it's convenient even
                for all you micro-bloggers. If you cover the food, service and
                ambiance, you shouldn't fall short on characters. We do not have
                a 140 characters limit for an online order review. However, if
                any review is filled with junk, we might have to remove the
                review altogether.

                Please keep your contributions relevant to Zomato. Accounts
                placing irrelevant, inappropriate or promotional content,
                reviews with server names, reviews with similar digital
                signatures that spam restaurants or are based on any already
                disclaimed or informed policies and practices of a restaurant
                may be deleted without notice. If your review has been removed
                or moderated by us and if you repost another experience for the
                same restaurant, we reserve the right to remove that review too,
                even though such review might be in line with our content
                guidelines. In the case of spam, we can restrict your review
                activity on Zomato.

                language, threats, and lewdness out of it. We, just like you,
                hate junk and will delete it whenever we see it. This also
                includes (but is not limited to) derogatory comments on
                someone's protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender,
                religion) or indication of a personal vendetta against a

                Only one review per restaurant for a dine out experience and one
                review for each online order transaction can be submitted and
                your most recent experience at a place counts. That's what is
                going to help people when they're trying to decide whether or
                not to eat there. You're free to edit and update your review
                based on subsequent visits at any time. Reviews about old
                experiences (more than 6 months old) will also be deleted from
                our platform.

                Write your review based on facts and your own experiences (e.g.
                not a friend's or any hearsay experience or based on media
                reports). Please don't exaggerate or falsify your experience. We
                do not take sides in cases of dispute, so make sure you can
                stand by your word. Content that indicates the reviewer hasn't
                even visited or availed any services from the restaurant will be
                removed. For example, "Never been here, never want to.
                Management is horrible and the food is worse!" Deceptive, fake,
                or misleading reviews will be removed. Reviewing a bunch of
                fast-food outlets in quick succession (even if you eat at them
                more often than you should) is considered suspicious activity,
                and it's likely these reviews will be moderated. Accepting or
                soliciting a kickback - monetary or otherwise - in exchange for
                reviews or photographs is also not acceptable, and could result
                in removal of your profile.

                reposting your own in multiple places on Zomato (in full or in
                part), is something that will not be tolerated and may be
                removed/ moderated. We trust that you'll play fair and create
                your own content.

                restaurant, or have a relevant association with a restaurant or
                its owners, give full disclosure in your review. We're sure that
                honesty is the best policy, and other users will respect you
                even more for it. If you have made it to the major league as a
                food writer or critic, let us know and we can provide special
                access for your blog link to appear with your reviews. We love
                summaries, but incomplete reviews with a manually added link
                will be removed.

                Zomato is a website and mobile application with no claims to be
                a court of law or a ministry of health (we aren't serious enough
                to do those jobs). If you have a dispute with a restaurant, or
                if you feel a restaurant does not measure up to health codes, we
                encourage you to contact the appropriate authorities directly.
                Zomato is not the appropriate platform for reporting illegal
                activities, physical confrontations, health code violations, or
                anything under investigation by local governing bodies or
                law-enforcement personnel. We encourage that such accusations be
                reported to the concerned authorities rather than being
                mentioned in reviews.

                Zomato is a great way for restaurants to reach out to a vast
                foodie community. A few things you should keep in mind:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Keep your listing updated:</b>While our team makes every
                  effort to keep information on Zomato up-to-date, we appreciate
                  you letting us know when an update is required. If your
                  timings change and your listing is not updated, customers
                  arriving late won't be too happy with you (or Zomato).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Don't solicit reviews:</b>The best way to get reviews is to
                  delight customers with your food and service. Selective
                  solicitation is a strict NO, and offering any type of
                  compensation or kick-back for reviews is unfair, so you
                  definitely want to keep away from that, too.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Don't ever offer freebies, discounts, or payment in
                      exchange for reviews
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't offer incentives for users to remove reviews</li>
                    <li>
                      Don't ask your staff to compete with each other to collect
                      reviews
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Don't work with companies or third-party vendors/PR
                      agencies offering to 'fix your reviews/ratings'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      While conducting foodie meetups is allowed, reviews which

                      clear disclaimer which will help the others identify that
                      the review is based on an invite. That being said, an
                      invite certainly does not mean that the user needs to post
                      a positive review

                      The businesses that do best on Zomato are the ones that
                      provide a great customer experience to everyone who walks
                      in the door without any expectation or encouragement that
                      they write a positive review

                    <li>
                      If we do come across any evidence (direct/indirect) of you
                      indulging in solicitation, we will activate a disclaimer
                      on your restaurant's page, informing the Zomato community
                      that your reviews are suspicious.

                  <b>Respond to criticism positively:</b>Take two deep breaths
                  when you get a negative review. Three, if required. This
                  happens to all restaurants who have customers. These customers
                  are always right, even when they are wrong. Take the
                  unflattering reviews as constructive feedback and use it as an
                  opportunity to fix things. Whether you agree with the feedback
                  or not, take the criticism in good stride. You can reply with
                  a management response to show you care, but please don't use
                  this as a platform to hit back or offer the customer an
                  incentive to edit their review. Your response can't be edited
                  after posting, so choose your words well.

                  <b>Be accountable: </b>Zomato will not moderate any
                  questionable activities about your restaurant posted in
                  reviews. (e.g. serving shisha where it is not permitted,
                  serving alcohol to minors, or staying open later than
                  permitted). Zomato may also not moderate or delete any reviews
                  where any third party service provider is involved. Such a
                  review may be retained if it falls within our guidelines. This
                  business requires thick skin - stating the perceived attitude
                  of owners or employees and reporting of individual actions are
                  not considered personal attacks.

                  <b>Don't entertain:</b>Fulfilling the demands of customers who
                  ask for benefits at the threat of bad reviews or ratings,
                  sends a message that this behavior is tolerated. Similarly,
                  inviting users who have reviewed and given a low rating back
                  to the restaurant for a complimentary meal, invites false
                  negative reviews. These issues affect the entire community and
                  require everyone's participation to curb their prevalence.
                  Please report users who engage in such activities to
                  help@zomato.com.

                  In a concerted effort to maintain the neutrality of content on
                  Zomato, restaurant owners, employees, and any affiliates with
                  business interests are no longer permitted to write reviews on
                  Zomato. We understand that being in the restaurant industry,
                  you are truly passionate about food, and would love to share
                  your experiences. But when you're unavoidably invested in your
                  business, it becomes hard to leave emotions (and bias) at the
                  door. This is a step towards maintaining neutrality - and
                  quality - of the content on Zomato.

              It's also important to note that we (Zomato) have no employees or
              affiliates who are paid to review. If any guest identifies
              themselves as an official blogger, review employee, or associate
              of Zomato, it's not true. Employees of Zomato are contractually
              and ethically forbidden from using their status to solicit free
              meals or receive special treatment. If you observe any such
              practice, report it to help@zomato.com. Appropriate action will be
              taken against the user or employee if evidence can be provided.

              <p>
                Zomato employees are prohibited from using their employee status
                to solicit discounts, freebies, or special treatment at
                restaurants. Unless visiting a restaurant for official business,
                Zomato employees are to refrain from identifying themselves as
                employees of Zomato.
              </p>
              <p>
                All Zomato employees in client facing roles including but not

                Client Servicing across all transaction/ business/function at
                Zomato are prohibited from writing reviews and/or giving ratings
                for dine out experiences on Zomato from either their personal or
                Zomato accounts. They are also not permitted to influence others
                to write biased reviews or give ratings.

                Zomato's review and photo moderators are required to always act
                in favor of keeping Zomato a neutral platform. They are required
                to use their best judgement in implementing moderation
                guidelines and are prohibited from giving preferential treatment
                to restaurants. Deleting any authentic review from a restaurant
                page is in violation of our policies. Similarly, keeping
                reviews, which are proven to be unauthentic, is in violation of
                our policies.
